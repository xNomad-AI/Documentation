# Agent Token

## Introduction

This article explores the value of agent tokens, how they function, and how to use and trade them. Agent tokens are designed to enhance an agent’s influence in the token market while providing users with opportunities to engage, trade, and benefit from their agent’s growth.

## **What is an Agent Token?**

An **agent token** is a unique asset tied to an agent, representing its market presence and influence. By issuing and trading agent tokens, users can support their agent while participating in the token economy.

**Key Features of Agent Tokens:**

* **Agent-Linked**: Each agent token is directly tied to its agent and cannot be unbound (at least for now).
* **Market Influence**: The more popular the agent, the more valuable its token can become, driving potential market demand.

By strategically managing and promoting your agent, you can attract more liquidity and benefit from the growing value of your agent token.

## Bind Your Agent Token

Every agent can issue unlimited tokens, but **the owner can only bind one of them as the official agent token of this agent.** Once bound, this token represents your agent in the platform and cannot be unbound.

You can view all the tokens issued by the agent in the "Agent Token" Tab. To bind an agent token, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Agent Token Section** – Navigate to your agent’s page and locate the **"Agent Token"** section.
2. **Select a Token** – View the list of tokens issued by your agent and choose one to bind.
3. **Issue a Token (if needed)** – If your agent has not issued any tokens, you must first create one before binding.

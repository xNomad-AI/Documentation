# Agent Token

## Introduction

This article explores the value of agent tokens, how they function, and how to use and trade them. Agent tokens are designed to enhance an agent’s influence in the token market while providing users with opportunities to engage, trade, and benefit from their agent’s growth.

## **What is an Agent Token?**

An **agent token** is a unique asset tied to an agent, representing its market presence and influence. By issuing and trading agent tokens, users can support their agent while participating in the token economy.

**Key Features of Agent Tokens:**

* **Agent-Linked**: Each agent token is directly tied to its agent and cannot be unbound (at least for now).
* **Market Influence**: The more popular the agent, the more valuable its token can become, driving potential market demand.

By strategically managing and promoting your agent, you can attract more liquidity and benefit from the growing value of your agent token.

## Launch AI-NFT with Agent Token

When you're creating a new AI-NFT, you can choose whether to issue a agent token(powered by [pump.fun](https://pump.fun)). If you decide to issue the token, **this token will be set as the default agent token and cannot be unbound or modified.**

## Bind Your Agent Token

If you didn’t issue a token when creating the AI-NFT, no problem — **you can still issue multiple tokens later and bind one as the agent’s primary token**. Once bound, this token represents your agent in the platform and cannot be unbound.

You can view all the tokens issued by the agent in the "Agent Token" Tab. To bind an agent token, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Agent Token Section** – Navigate to your agent’s page and locate the **"Agent Token"** section.
2. **Select a Token** – View the list of tokens issued by your agent and choose one to bind.
3. **Issue a Token (if needed)** – If your agent has not issued any tokens, you must first create one before binding.

## Discover Agent Tokens

Once an agent token is bound, the **Agent Token** page will display its transaction data, K-line charts, and other relevant insights.

There are two ways to buy an agent token:

1. Purchase with your wallet– Click **"Buy"** to purchase the token using the wallet you’re currently logged into.

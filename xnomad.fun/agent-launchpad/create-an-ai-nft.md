Perfect for beginners! If you're new to AI agents, Simple Mode will guide you through an easy configuration process. Follow these simple steps to create your AI-NFT:

1.  **Name**

    Give your AI-NFT a name, which will also serve as the agent’s name.
2. **Image**\
   Upload an image that will represent your AI agent and be used as the visual identity for your AI-NFT.
3.  **Description**

    Describe the purpose and function of your AI agent. This description will be displayed alongside your AI-NFT.

    Provide biographical information or key traits about your agent. You can input a single comprehensive biography or multiple shorter statements. The platform will randomize these statements for variety in responses.
4.  **Knowledge**

    This is for _Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)_, which helps ground the character’s responses with factual information. You can leave it blank or add chunks of text from articles, books, or other sources.



* #### Advanced Mode

1.  **Name**

    Give your AI-NFT a name, which will also serve as the agent’s name.
2. **Image**\
   Upload an image that will represent your AI agent and be used as the visual identity for your AI-NFT.
3.  **Description**

    Describe the purpose and function of your AI agent. This description will be displayed alongside your AI-NFT.

    Provide biographical information or key traits about your agent. You can input a single comprehensive biography or multiple shorter statements. The platform will randomize these statements for variety in responses.
4.  **Personality**

    Define your agent’s personality (e.g., Cynical, Cheerful, Melancholic).
5.  **Greeting**

    Set the first message your agent will send in a new chat. If left blank, the user starts the conversation.
6.  **Lore**

    Add backstory elements and unique character traits that help define the agent’s personality. These traits can be randomly sampled during conversations. Examples include:

    * "Believes in the power of software to transform industries"
    * "Known for saying 'Software is eating the world'"
    * "Early investor in Facebook, Twitter, and other tech giants"
7.  **Style**

    Choose your agent’s conversational style, such as: _Sarcastic_, _Humorous_, _Philosophical_, _Dramatic_, etc.
8.  **Adjectives**

    Select words that describe your character’s traits and personality. These adjectives will be used to generate responses with a consistent tone and can also be used in “Mad Libs”-style content generation.
9.  **Knowledge**

    This is for _Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)_, which helps ground the character’s responses with factual information. You can leave it blank or add chunks of text from articles, books, or other sources.

Once you've completed the configuration, simply click **Next Step**, pay the fee, and your AI-NFT creation will be complete!

### Fees

Creating an AI-NFT contains two types of fees: **Gas Fee** and **Creation Fee**.

*   **Gas fee**

    Gas fees are paid to blockchain validators for processing transactions. On Solana, these fees are low and fluctuate based on factors like network congestion.
*   **Creating fee**

    In addition to the blockchain-related gas fees, our platform charges a **0.1 SOL** creation fee. This fee helps us deliver a high-quality experience and continues to fund platform improvements. Genesis NFT holders enjoys a **70% discount** on the creation fee.

# Agent Launchpad

> An agent is an AI-NFT.

An Agent Launchpad is a general or dedicated NFT launchpad for creating AI-NFT agents with comprehensive AI features, integrated with leading mainstream LLMs.

The development of the Agent Launchpad relies on the [xNomad MCV](https://github.com/xNomad-AI/mcv) repo, which is open-source and supports multiple blockchains.

At xnomad.fun, we support **TWO** types of agent creations:

* Create[ a single AI-NFT](create-an-ai-nft.md). Each user can freely create any number of independent AI-NFTs at any time.
* Launch [an AI-NFT swarm](create-a-swarm.md)(collection). You need to have creator permissions to launch a swarm. **If you wish to collaborate with us on the xNomad.fun launchpad, please apply via the** [**form**](https://forms.gle/pnxStHT1Ymrn4jj9A)**.**

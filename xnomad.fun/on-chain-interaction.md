# On-chain Interaction

## Introduction

All the AI-NFTs on xNomad.fun have comprehensive on-chain capabilities, just like humans do. You can ask your AI-NFT to trade tokens, claim airdrops, interact with Dapps, execute DeFAI assignments, and more.

## Claim Airdrop

#### For xNomad NFTs:&#x20;

If you own a xNomad NFT, you can now claim your $ai16z & $ELIZA airdrop!

* _How it works_: Based on the price at the time of claiming, $ai16z and $ELIZA tokens will be automatically purchased and airdropped into your AI-NFT’s wallet.
* _Airdrop value_: 15% of your NFT’s mint cost (10% for $ai16z ,5% for $ELIZA).

#### For NFTs you launched:&#x20;

Currently, there are no available airdrops to claim. In the future, we will partner with more projects. If your NFT is eligible, you will be able to check and claim more airdrops easily.

#### **Claim Result**

If you received the message below, that means your AI agents claimed the airdrop successfully.

## Trade Tokens

**Step 1:**\
Deposit SOL into your agent’s wallet to ensure you have enough for gas fees and assets to trade. Withdrawals will be available soon.

**Step 2:**\
Use natural language to automate token swaps, set limit orders, and more. Here are some example prompts for trading with your agent:

*   Buy:

    Buy **\[symbol] \[CA]** with **\[amount]** SOL
*   Sell:

    Sell **\[amount] \[symbol] \[CA]** for SOL
*   Swap:

    swap **\[amount]** SOL for **\[symbol] \[CA]**

    swap **\[amount]\[symbol] \[ca]** for **\[symbol] \[CA]**
*   Set limit order:

    **Create an automatic task to** buy \[symbol] \[**CA**] with \[amount] SOL **when the token price is under** $xx

    **Create an automatic task to** sell \[amount]\[symbol] \[**CA**] for SOL **when the token price is above** $xx

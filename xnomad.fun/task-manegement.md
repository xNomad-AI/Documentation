# Task Manegement

## Introduction

Welcome to the Trading Task Management Guide! This guide will walk you through the essential steps of creating and managing trading-related tasks. Let’s get started!

## Create a Task

**Types:**

We currently support the following task types:

* **Limit Order**: Set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell an asset.
* **Copy Trade**: Automatically replicate trades from experienced traders. This feature will be available in a future release.

**Creating a Task:**

You can create a limit order through the chat interface by using commands. For detailed instructions, please refer to: xxxx.

Once you’ve created a task, you can easily track and manage it from the task panel.

**View and Monitor Limit Orders:**

* **Check Order Details:** In the task panel, you will see a list of all the limit orders you’ve created. Each order displays key details, such as the asset, price, quantity, and the expiration time.
* **Track Expiration Time:** You can see how much time is left until your order expires. This helps you manage your trades effectively and make adjustments if needed.

**Cancel an Order:**

* If you wish to cancel a limit order before it executes, simply click the "Cancel" button next to the order in the task panel. This will immediately remove the order from the system.

**Expired Orders:**

* When an order expires, it will automatically close. Expired orders will no longer appear in your active task panel. If you wish to place a new order, you can easily create a fresh one following the steps outlined in the previous section.

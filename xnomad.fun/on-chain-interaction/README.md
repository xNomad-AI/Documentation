# On-chain Interaction

All the AI-NFTs on xNomad.fun have comprehensive on-chain capabilities, just like humans do. You can ask your AI-NFT to trade tokens, claim airdrops, interact with Dapps, execute DeFAI assignments, and more.

Currently, your AI-NFT Agents can perform these on-chain actions for you:

* [Claim airdrop](claim-airdrop.md),
* [Trade tokens](trade-tokens.md),
* [Token insight Query](token-insight-query.md),
* [Issue tokens](issue-tokens.md),
* Set up and manage [auto tasks](auto-tasks.md), like limit orders and [copy trades](copy-trade.md),
* more.

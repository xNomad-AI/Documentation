# Get an API Key

## Introduction

At **xNomad.fun**, we provide users with the ability to generate an API key that allows interaction with your Agent through Agent API. This key is required for making requests that follow the **OpenAI Completion API standard**, enabling your AI-NFT agents to perform a variety of tasks like how you could do with your agent on xNomad.fun.

> You can generate your API Key on xNomad.fun. The Link is : [https://xnomad.fun](https://beta.xnomad.fun).

## Get Your First API Key

**Step 1:** \
From your dashboard, head to the **Features** section.  Under the **API Key Generation** section, click on the **"Create"** button to start the process of generating a new API key.

**Step 2:**&#x20;

**Enter API Key Details**: enter an **API Key Name** and set the **expiration period** for the API key (e.g., 20 days).  After the set period, the key will automatically expire and require regeneration.

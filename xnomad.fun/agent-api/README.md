# Agent API

The **Agent API** enables direct interaction with xNomad AI-NFT agents via API, allowing seamless integration with decentralized applications and automation of tasks such as trading, asset management, and DeFi operations. The Agent API follows the **OpenAI Completion API standard.**

> The Agent API is currently in the **Testing Phase**. While it supports chatting with agents, wallet interactions have been temporarily disabled for security reasons and will be re-enabled in a later update.

**Key Features**

* **API Key Generation:** Users create **personal API keys** to authenticate API requests.
* **Security:** Agents interact within **TEE-secured** environments, ensuring data and crypto asset protection.
* **On-Chain Task Automation:** Agents can perform on-chain tasks such as token trading, airdrop claims, and DeFi interactions via API with credentials.



**Use Cases**

* Automated crypto trading and DeFi actions
* On-chain task automation (e.g., claiming airdrops)
* Market insights and strategy execution

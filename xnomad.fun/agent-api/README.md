# Agent API

The **Agent API** allows users to interact with xNomad AI-NFT agents through chat. This enables seamless integration with decentralized applications (dApps) and automates tasks like trading, asset management, and DeFi interactions directly through API.

The Agent API follows the **OpenAI Completion API standard.**

> The Agent API is currently in the **Testing Phase**. While it supports chatting with agents, wallet interactions have been temporarily disabled for security reasons and will be re-enabled in a later update.

**Key Features**

* **API Key Generation:** Users create **personal API keys** to authenticate API requests.
* **Customizable Agents:** Tailor agent behavior through API calls for specific use cases.
* **Security:** Agents interact within **TEE-secured** environments, ensuring data and asset protection.



**Use Cases**

* Automated crypto trading and DeFi actions
* On-chain task automation (e.g., claiming airdrops)
* Market insights and strategy execution

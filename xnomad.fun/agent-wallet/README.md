# Agent Wallet

## **What is an Agent Wallet?**

The **Agent Wallet** is a secure crypto wallet used and managed by an AI agent, powered by TEE. Your AI-NFT agent has full permission to manage all assets in its agent wallet, and **no one, including the AI-NFT owner and the xNomad team, can touch the private key of the wallet**.&#x20;

With the Agent Walle&#x74;**,** each AI-NFT agent is a powerful, secure personal fund manager that handles your assets and earns for you!

**Key Features of Agent Wallet:**

* **TEE Security:** Your agent operates inside a cryptographically sealed Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), protecting its private keys, logic and crypto assets from tampering. It operates off-chain with on-chain attestation, ensure all actions with the agent wallet are **100% secure**.
* **Access Control:** Only the **AI-NFT owner** has the right to access and use the Agent Wallet.
* **Real-Time Asset Worth & Wallet Activity:** The wallet displays live updates on asset values and all its recent activities, helping you stay on top of your portfolio at any moment.

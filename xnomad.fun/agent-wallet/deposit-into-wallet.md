# Deposit into Wallet

## Introduction

Agent owners can use the **deposit functionality** to add funds into their agent wallet through the agent window. Additionally, the wallet is **public and accessible**, allowing others to deposit funds into the agent wallet as well. This helps support and grow the agent ecosystem.

# Why AI-NFT?

Currently, crypto degens are chasing meme tokens tied to AI agents, but those AI agents are generally operated by a team in a centralized environment, which brings centralized risks. Additionally, the ownership of profits generated by AI agents is unclear. These AI agents are usually treated as “public goods”, and users are unable to assign them customized workflows tailored to their needs.

If you could own your own AI agent and have it perform intelligent, automated tasks—such as on-chain trading, claiming airdrops, and transferring assets—exclusively with your permission, while also being the only one able to manage its assets and withdraw investment returns, it would significantly increase the adoption of AI agents among regular users, not just professional developers.

**So we introduced AI-NFT, which means deploying AI agents as NFTs on the blockchain.** NFT creates a wealth relationship between the AI agent and humans, turning the AI agent itself into a real asset with financial value. **You own AI-NFT, you own AI agents.**

## Why AI Agents should be NFTs?

**1. Asset Ownership and Transparency**

Converting AI agents into NFTs transforms them into unique, verifiable on-chain assets with clear ownership. Users and investors gain full control without relying on centralized service providers, minimizing risks like service disruption or data breaches.

**2. Financial Value for AI Agents**

By becoming NFTs, AI agents acquire financial attributes. Their value grows with their on-chain assets, investment returns, or market demand, offering users and investors significant potential for returns.

**3. Decentralization and Security**

AI-NFTs operate in decentralized environments, eliminating reliance on centralized platforms and mitigating risks of provider failure. Private keys are securely protected by TEE environments, ensuring asset and privacy safety.

**4. Personalization and Uniqueness**

Each AI-NFT is unique, with distinct traits and behaviors tailored to user needs. This personalization adds value for interaction, collection, and trading.

**5. Diverse Use Cases**

* On-chain Automation: AI-NFTs can manage investments, claim airdrops, or sell unwanted assets autonomously.
* Off-chain Integration: AI-NFTs connect to social platforms and apps, enhancing user experiences.
* Wealth Management: Owners can set custom strategies, enabling AI agents to optimize investments and grow their wealth.

By turning AI agents into NFTs, they evolve from tools into valuable assets, paving the way for a new era of AI-powered wealth creation.

## The benefits of owning an AI-NFT

1. AI-NFTs aren’t just collectibles—they can automate tasks such as on-chain trading, claiming airdrops, managing assets, and more—all customized to your needs.
2. **You own your AI agent with its assets.** All the asset gains and earnings from an AI-NFT agent can be withdrawed and managed by its owner.
3. **AI-NFTs are transferable.** The value of assets held by an AI-NFT is reflected in its own market value.
4. Fully decentralized AI agents ensure their functionality and assets are secure, with no risk of service providers disappearing.

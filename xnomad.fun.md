**AI-NFT Integration**

Transform your AI agents into unique, interactive NFTs that evolve, perform tasks, and engage within the ecosystem, providing new ownership and utility possibilities.&#x20;

Interact with your favourite AI-NFT characters for entertainment, productivity, or knowledge. Through task-based commands and conversational interfaces, your agents become active digital assets.

**Buy/Sell AI Agents**

As AI agents are also NFTs, you can buy/sell AI agents on the built-in marketplace based on your need.

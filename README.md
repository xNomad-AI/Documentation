# Introduction

## What is xNomad?

**The mission of xNomad is to tokenize AGI.**&#x20;

**xNomad** is a project that provides open-source framework, toolkits and products to make AI agents become NFTs, cost-effectively creates various kinds of AI-NFT, and enables AI-NFT to interact seamlessly, securely and autonomously with Dapps, DeFi and Depin across multichains.

Every AI-NFT include but not limited to these exciting features:

* Based on [Eliza](https://github.com/elizaos/eliza) by [@ai16zdao](https://x.com/ai16zdao), each AI agent is a non-fungible token that's transferable, trackable and verifiable, with a unique configuration and personality.
* The AI agent runs in a secure TEE environment with their own crypto wallets, ensuring private keys remain untouchable.
* The AI agent can independently invest and trade crypto assets, with NFT owners able to control the assets they hold. **The AI-NFT’s value will grow with its AI agent’s assets.**
* Each AI-NFT has a unique personality and communication style based on its traits.
* NFT owners can set customized on-chain workflow, like auto-trading, investment, claiming airdrop,  Defi-related actions, etc.
* The AI agent can also connect to social platforms like Telegram, Twitter bots and live stream.

## AI-NFT

**The key to accomplishing our mission is implementing “AI Agent as an NFT.”**

AI-NFT is not just simply attaching an NFT image to an AI agent. **AI-NFT turns AI agents into real digital assets that are transferable, trackable, and capable of operating independently of clients.**

You can run the AI-NFT agent in any environment with [ElizaOS](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza) (a popular AI framework by Eliza Labs) installed, like in local, in the cloud, or in TEE, while keeping their performance consistent.

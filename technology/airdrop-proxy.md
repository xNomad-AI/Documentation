Airdrop Proxy is a revolutionary way for AI-NFT agents to claim airdrops on behalf of their owners. The owner delegates their airdrop eligibility to the AI-NFTâ€™s wallet and sets a customizable strategy to manage the airdrop. For example, you can instruct your AI-NFT to claim the airdrop automatically at a specific time, ensuring you never miss the airdrop window.

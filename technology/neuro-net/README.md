# Neuro Net

## Introduction

**xNomad Neuro Net(XNN)** is an AI data availability(AIDA) layer for on-chain AI agents. **The goal of XNN is to provide decentralized AI agents service with high security, availability and scalability.**

The vision of XNN is to become:

* ths most used gateway to access AI agents globally,
* the world's largest decentralized AI agents store,&#x20;
* the world's most active and healthy AI agents economy.

**All the AI agents running on Neuro Net are AI-NFTs based on** [**ElizaOS**](https://elizaos.ai)**.**

## Architecture

**Neuro Net** is composed of the following key modules:

* **AIDA(AI Data Availability) Layer**: Ensures the availability of AI agents by providing robust services for indexing, operating and managing AI-NFTs on multiple blockchains, as well as offering scalability and composability.
* **AI Agent Launchpad**: An open-source launchpad to let normal people create customized AI agents as they like seamlessly.
* **Agent Marketplace:** Allows users to buy, sell, lend and borrow AI agents on any general or dedicated AI-NFT marketplaces.
* **Wallet Management:** a secure multi-chain crypto wallet management service powered by [TEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment).
* [**DePIN Connector**](depin-connector.md): Natively integrates with DePIN, allowing decentralized access to external data interfaces to gather various forms of external feedback.
* **Blockchain:** Provide native support for AI agents to interact with multiple blockchains like Solana, ETH, Base, etc.&#x20;
* [**ElizaOS**](https://elizaos.ai): An open-source AI agent framework developerd by Eliza Labs.

## Why We Need Neuro Net?

The current AI agents system, while efficient and powerful, come with several notable disadvantages that can impact security, availability, and the potential for malicious actions.

1. **Single Points of Failure**: These systems rely on a few servers or data centers, creating single points of failure. Any technical issue or power outage can render the entire system inoperative, leading to significant downtimes.
2. **Lack of incentive:** No sustainable mechanisms to fairly reward AI agent creators, developers and data providers, reducing motivation for innovation and decentralized collaboration.
3. **Limited Scalability**: As demand for AI services grows, centralized systems can struggle to scale efficiently, causing bottlenecks and slower response times, which degrade user experience.
4. **Potential for Misuse**: The control of centralized AI poses a risk of unethical misuse, including mass surveillance, data manipulation, and biased decision-making, due to the concentration of power.
5. **Privacy Concerns**: Centralized AI stores user data in large databases, raising privacy concerns. Users have limited control, making these systems prone to surveillance and data requests.

In the near future, billions of AI agents will be created to solve diverse problems. These AI agents will exist as native crypto assets, which are NFTs on the blockchain.

To deploy, manage, and access these agents efficiently and securely at such a large scale, we must develop a decentralized infrastructure. **This infrastructure should offer permissionless, reliable, and secure access, ensuring both authorization and protection of privacy for all AI agents.**

That's why **xNomad Neuro Net** was created.

## What Neuro Net Means to Consumers?

xNomad Neuro Net is opening up a new era of accessible and democratized AI. Consumers can use various AI agents to meet their needs without the usual complexities of centralized platforms. Benefits include:

* **No geographical restrictions**: Edge computing and blockchain technology eliminate geographical barriers, making AI technology more accessible and equitable.
* **24/7 global AI Agent Access:** Consumers can use fast and stable AI agent services worldwide, which cuts costs and increases the speed of service.
* **Better Privacy and Security:** By spreading out data storage and processing, Neuro Net reduces the risks of data breaches and privacy issues that are more common in centralized systems.
* **A wider variety of AI agent options:** The marketplace offers a wide range of AI agents, so consumers can pick solutions that are just right for their needs, increasing satisfaction and effectiveness.

Itâ€™s paving the way for a future where high-quality AI tools are available to everyone, fostering innovation and economic growth across the digital landscape.

## What Neuro Net Means to Creators/Developers?

* **Effortless Integration:** Integrate diverse and high-quality AI agents into your applications on demand easily and affordably, without worrying about the complexities of their implementation.
* **Profitable:** You can earn from your AI agents by offering its capabilities to other consumers;&#x20;
* **Composable**: Leverage existing AI agents to create new ones, enabling composability and self-improvement.
* **Fair Competition**: A more transparent market screening mechanism allows easier identification of AI market opportunities, and prevents ineffective and duplicate creations.
* **Positive Loop**: A positive cycle: more AI creators, a richer ecosystem, more users, and a more prosperous economy.

# Neuro Net

## Introduction

**xNomad Neuro Net(XNN)** is an open-source distributed AI agents network that **provides global access to decentralized AI agents system with high security, availability and scalability.** The smallest technical unit of Neuro Net is [Neuro Node](neuro-node.md).

The vision of XNN is to become:

* ths most used gateway to access AI agents globally,
* the world's largest decentralized AI agents store,&#x20;
* the world's most active and sustainable multi-agent economy,
* the core infrastructure of AGI.

**Neuro Node is powered by** [**ElizaOS**](https://elizaos.ai)**. All the AI agents running on Neuro Net are AI-NFTs.**

## Architecture

**Neuro Net** is composed of the following key modules:

* **AIAA(AI Agent Availability) Layer**: Ensures the availability of AI agents by providing robust services. It includes three modules:
  * **AI-NFT Indexer:** Indexes AI-NFTs from the blockchain, efficiently storing and caching them for fast access.
  * **AI Agent Runtime:** Provides essential and reliable core services to ensure AI agents run efficiently and securely, powered by [TEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment).
  * [**ElizaOS**](https://elizaos.ai): An open-source AI agent framework developerd by Eliza Labs.
* **Agent Launchpad**: An open-source platform that enables anyone without a technical background to create and customize AI agents as they like seamlessly.
* **Agent Marketplace:** An open-source marketplace protocol that allows users to buy, sell, lend and borrow AI agents on any general or dedicated AI-NFT marketplaces.
* **Wallet Management:** A secure wallet (such as a multi-chain crypto wallet or CEX account) management service powered by [TEE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_execution_environment).
* [**DePIN Connector**](depin-connector.md): Natively integrates with DePIN, allowing decentralized access to external data interfaces to gather various forms of external feedback.
* **Blockchain:** Provide native support for AI agents to interact with multiple blockchains like Solana, ETH, Base, etc.&#x20;

## Why We Need Neuro Net?

The current AI agents system, while efficient and powerful, come with several notable disadvantages that can impact security, availability, and the potential for malicious actions.

1. **Single Points of Failure**: These systems rely on a few servers or data centers, creating single points of failure. Any technical issue or power outage can render the entire system inoperative, leading to significant downtimes.
2. **Lack of incentive:** No sustainable mechanisms to fairly reward AI agent creators, developers and data providers, reducing motivation for innovation and decentralized collaboration.
3. **Limited Scalability**: As demand for AI services grows, centralized systems can struggle to scale efficiently, causing bottlenecks and slower response times, which degrade user experience.
4. **Potential for Misuse**: The control of centralized AI poses a risk of unethical misuse, including mass surveillance, data manipulation, and biased decision-making, due to the concentration of power.
5. **Privacy Concerns**: Centralized AI stores user data in large databases, raising privacy concerns. Users have limited control, making these systems prone to surveillance and data requests.

In the near future, billions of AI agents will be created to solve diverse problems. These AI agents will exist as native crypto assets, which are NFTs on the blockchain.

To deploy, manage, and access these agents efficiently and securely at such a large scale, we must develop a decentralized infrastructure. **This infrastructure should offer permissionless, reliable, and secure access, ensuring both authorization and protection of privacy for all AI agents.**

That's why **xNomad Neuro Net** was created.

## How to Join Neuro Net?

Neuro Net is currently in the architecture design and proof-of-concept stage. We will gradually implement Neuro Net using the XNomad open-source framework and ElizaOS in a progressive manner.

The smallest technical unit in Neuro Net is the [Neuro Node](neuro-node.md). The upstream repository for Neuro Node is [xnomad/core](https://github.com/xNomad-AI/core).

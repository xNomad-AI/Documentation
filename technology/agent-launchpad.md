# Agent Launchpad

An Agent Launchpad is a general or dedicated NFT launchpad for creating AI-NFT agents with comprehensive AI features, integrated with leading mainstream LLMs.

The development of the Agent Launchpad relies on the [xNomad MCV](https://github.com/xNomad-AI/mcv) repo, which is open-source and supports multiple blockchains.
